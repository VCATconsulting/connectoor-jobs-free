== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the Connectoor WordPress Plugin?

The Connectoor WordPress Plugin is a tool that helps companies easily, securely, and cost-effectively publish their job listings on their own career page. It offers both a free and a Pro version, which includes additional features and integration with the Connectoor recruiting system.

= How can I install the plugin?

The plugin can be installed directly through the WordPress dashboard. Search for “Connectoor Jobs" in the plugin directory, click on “Install,” and then “Activate.” Further instructions can be found in our installation documentation.

= What features does the free version of the plugin offer?

The free version allows the publication of job listings on your career page. You can include important information such as location, type of employment, and start date in your job postings, and they are displayed in an SEO-optimized manner.

= What are the benefits of the Pro version?

The Pro version offers seamless integration with the Connectoor recruiting system. This enables the automatic posting of job listings directly from Connectoor, as well as AI-supported job listing creation. Additionally, job listings are published on approximately 20 job portals for free. Another major advantage is the GDPR-compliant and process-optimized applicant management within the Connectoor e-recruiting system.

= How does the Connectoor Plugin differ from other job plugins?

With the Connectoor Jobs Free plugin, you can easily and securely publish jobs on your own career site. With the individual “Apply button” you can forward potential talents directly to your application form or external forms from your recruiting software. However, we recommend that you manage all applications quickly and securely in the Connectoor applicant management system.

= Is the plugin GDPR-compliant?

Yes, the Connectoor WordPress Plugin and the associated Connectoor recruiting system are GDPR-compliant. It provides functions for the secure management and storage of applicant data in accordance with data protection regulations. All personal data is stored on German servers. Additionally, applicant data is automatically pseudonymized or deleted within the Connectoor recruiting system after specified periods, in compliance with data protection regulations.

= Can I customize the design of the job listings?

Yes, the plugin allows you to customize the appearance of job listings to match your corporate design. You can adjust colors and layouts to fit your brand and add custom images and banners.

= How does the plugin help with SEO optimization?

The plugin ensures that your job listings are optimized for search engines by providing the correct meta tags, titles, and descriptions in the proper format. This increases the visibility of your job listings on search engines like Google.

= Is there a way to receive applications directly through the plugin?

Yes, the plugin allows you to receive applications directly through your website. You can decide whether applications should be submitted via email (1), through an online form (2), or in other ways. However, we recommend managing applicants in a GDPR-compliant and process-optimized manner using Connectoor. This is the safest way to manage applicants’ personal data efficiently.

(1) Please note: If you receive personal data via email, you are responsible for processing and deleting it. Most companies cannot ensure this securely and in compliance with GDPR according to common assessments. Please inform yourself about the requirements you need to meet if you want to manage applicant data in your company without a recruiting software.
(2) We do not provide an application form in this plugin. This is part of the Connectoor recruiting system and can be used in a GDPR-compliant manner through this method. If you wish to create your own form in the free plugin, you can do so at your own responsibility using a form builder. However, please be aware of our data protection warnings regarding the handling of applicants’ personal data!

= What happens if I need technical support?

Our support team is available in the PRO version and, of course, for Connectoor itself to answer technical questions and assist you with problem-solving. You can reach us via email or through our support portal. In the free version of our plugin, we ask you to primarily refer to our documentation.

= Is Connectoor offered outside the German-speaking region?

The current version of our recruiting software, Connectoor, is specifically developed and optimized for the German-speaking region. While our clients receive international applications daily, the companies using Connectoor are primarily located in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Additional countries where we plan to offer the next generation of Connectoor are planned but not yet implemented. You are welcome to use the Connectoor Jobs Free plugin internationally, because the plugin comes with the general language markup.
